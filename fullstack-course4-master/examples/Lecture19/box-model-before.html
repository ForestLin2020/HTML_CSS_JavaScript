<div id="box">
  <div id="content">and refresh this again, it's the same thing. However, there's a couple more options we could do. Number one is we could just clip it. So in order to clip it, we could go ahead and type hidden, so if it If it's hidden, then if we refresh, it'll just go ahead and clip it where the box ends. However, there's a couple more options we could do. We could say auto. Auto means go ahead and put scroll bars wherever they're needed, in order for us to look at the entire content. And so let's go ahead and refresh that, and you can see I have a scroll bar here, and I can now scroll through my entire content right inside that box. If I wanted to, I can keep the scroll gutters always visible, no matter whether or not I need them or not, by just saying scroll, as the property value. If I refresh, now I have scroll both ways even though there is nothing to scroll here, but I could still elit.
